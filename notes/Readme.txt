This test project was made as an experiment. I made this to teach myself graphics programming and to see if
complex 3d graphics are possible in GameMaker.

I am not a professional games programmer. I am not a professional graphics programmer. I am a self-taught hobbiest
who learns by making experiments like this.

If you are looking to learn something from this project, then please also learn from other more reliable 
sources at the same time. 
If you know a lot about games and graphics programming and you see some areas 
for improvement, then please let me know. https://twitter.com/FreddiePotato

I could not have made this without help from online tutorials and GameMaker community members. Here are
some of the sources I used to learn how all this stuff works:
